# go-util

General reusable Go Utility code developed to support [github.com/mikebd/go-sharpen-blade](https://github.com/mikebd/go-sharpen-blade)
and other repositories, private and public.

## Minimal Third-Party Dependencies

* This repository may minimize third-party library dependencies, but not obsessively so as a goal in itself.
* Opportunities may be taken for learning or other purposes to implement functionality here that is available in third-party
  libraries.  These may be replaced with third-party libraries in the future as needs and interest change or time allows.
